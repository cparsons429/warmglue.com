It is generally used to improve the product experience. Any personal data that warmglue receives from third parties will be treated with the same care that warmglue treats data directly received from users and in accordance with applicable standards.
<br><br>
warmglue may be legally compelled - due to law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence - to disclose your personal information or non-personal information.

<br><br>
warmglue reserves the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information believed necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply the warmglue terms of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of warmglue, warmglue employees, warmglue users, or others.

You should review those policies when visiting third party websites. warmglue is not responsible for linked websites, and will provide those links solely for the convenience and information of users. warmglue may use data from these other sites or services to customize content for you, improve warmglue’s services, and so on.

Using an SSL-enabled browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer is required when your personal information is transmitted over the Internet.
<br><br>
When you use some warmglue features, such as sharing profile information or posting comments, the personal information and non-personal information you share are visible to others and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the information you disclose in this way. For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public.
<br><br>
While warmglue takes reasonable steps to ensure the integrity and security of warmglue’s network and systems, warmglue cannot guarantee these security measures will prevent third parties from obtaining personal information or non-personal information by illegal actions or attacks. Should such an attack occur, warmglue will notify you via email in accordance with local law and any applicable requirements, and will supply the appropriate authorities with available information on the third party in the event the attack comes under prosecution.
<br><br>
The failure of warmglue to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this agreement does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision or portion of this agreement to unenforceable, the remainder of this agreement will continue in full force and effect.
