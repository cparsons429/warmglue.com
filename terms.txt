<br><br>
Any unauthorized use of the warmglue system is a violation of this agreement, certain United States federal and state laws, and potentially certain laws local to your legal jurisdiction. Such violations may subject the unauthorized user and his or her agents to civil and criminal penalties.

The products, software, and services may collect certain non-personally identifiable information that resides on your device, including, without limitation, statistics relating to how often it is used, performance metrics relating to the products, software, and services, and configuration settings.

Certain third party code may be provided with the products, software, and services. The third party license terms accompanying such code, and not the terms of this agreement, will govern your use of such code. warmglue reserves all other rights to its products, software, and services.

<br><br>
At no time will a refund be issued for a service period of less than one calendar month. warmglue does not offer any refunds for purchases of the products, software, and services, except as expressly provided in this agreement.
<br><br>
The material displayed or performed or available on or through the products, software, and services, including, but not limited to, text, graphics, data, articles, photos, images, illustrations, user submissions, and so forth (all of the forgoing, the “content”) are protected as copyright or intellectual property. You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any content your access through the products, software, and services, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell, or otherwise exploit for any purpose any content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s (including warmglue’s) rights. The products, software, and services may allow you to copy or download certain content; please remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn’t mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply - they do!
<br><br>
Anything you upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the products, software, and services is your “user submission.” Some user submissions are viewable by other users. For clarity, information about other individuals (whether or not they are warmglue users) that you submit to or share through the products, software, or services is your “user submission.” In order to display your user submissions on the products, software, and services, and to allow other users to leverage them, you grant warmglue certain rights in those user submissions. Please note that all of the following licenses are subject to warmglue’s privacy policy to the extent they relate user submission that are also your personally identifiable information. For all user submissions, you grant warmglue a license to translate, modify (for example, making sure your content is visible on a mobile device as well as a computer), reproduce, and otherwise act with respect to such user submissions, in each case to enable warmglue to operate the products, software, and services, as described in more detail below. This is a license only - your ownership in user submissions is not affected.
<br><br>
If you store a user submission in your own personal warmglue account, in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except you (a “personal user submission”) you grant warmglue the license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your personal user submission for the sole purpose of making that personal user submission accessible to you and providing the products, software, and services necessary to do so. If you share a user submission only in a manner that only certain specified users can view (for example, by sharing contact or calendar information with one or more users) (a “limited audience user submission”), then you grant warmglue the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your limited audience user submission for the sole purpose of making that limited audience user submission accessible to such other specified users, and providing the products, software, and services necessary to do so. Also, you grant such other specified users a license to access that limited audience user submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the products, software, and services.
<br><br>
You agree that the licenses you grant are perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable, worldwide, transferable, with right of sublicense. Furthermore, you understand and agree that warmglue, in performing the required technical steps to provide the products, software, and services to users (including you), may need to make changes to your user submissions to conform and adapt those user submissions to the technical requirements of connected networks, devices, services, or media, and the forgoing licenses include the rights to do so.
<br><br>
You acknowledge that warmglue or third parties own all right, title, and interest in and to the computer source code related to the products, software, and services, portions thereof, or software or content provided through or in conjunction with the products, software, or services, including without limitation all intellectual property rights. Except for the license granted in this section, all rights in and to the products, software, or services are reserved, and no implied licenses are granted by warmglue.

<br><br>
Account termination may result in destruction of any content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account. warmglue will try to provide you advance notice prior to terminating your account so that you can retrieve important user submissions stored in your account (to the extent allowed by law and these terms), but warmglue may not do so if it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone’s safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights, property, operations, or interests of warmglue.
<br><br>
The terms in this agreement concerning consent to collect non-personal information; intellectual property; disclaimer of warranties; limitation of liabilities; obligations you have to pay or indemnify us; governing law, dispute resolution, and venue; user submissions, personal user submissions, and limited audience user submissions; and entire agreement and assignment will survive expiration or termination.

<br><br>
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND WARMGLUE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
<br><br>
To the extent that the arbitration provisions of this agreement do not apply, this agreement will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts serving San Francisco County, California, United States, in English, and the parties agree and submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of these courts, except that nothing will prohibit warmglue from instituting an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to obtain injunctive relief or protect or enforce its intellectual property rights.
<br><br>
